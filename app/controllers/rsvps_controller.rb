      you are X. the bot is O. board cells are numbered 1-9:

       1 | 2 | 3
      -----------
       4 | 5 | 6
      -----------
       7 | 8 | 9

      to play: reply to the rsvp stardance email with a single number 1-9.
      that cell becomes your X. the bot picks an empty cell as O and
      replies back with the new board.

      first to three in a row wins. all nine filled with no winner = draw.
